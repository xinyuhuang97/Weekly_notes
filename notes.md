a) pi(1)=2 pi(2)=1 pi(3)=3 pi(4)=4

b) We can first fix the first position, thus three possibility, and then the number will be 

3x3x2x1=18

If pi(1)=1 and pi(2)!=2, then 2x2x1=4

c)M_k

d)

Q2)

a)$P(A\cap B)=0, if independent P(A\cap B)=P(A)*P(B)>0$, which contradict 

b)

Q3)first we place four balls in each boxes:

$C^3_7\times4!\times4^3$

Q4)

suppose they are also independent

$P(A+B^c)=P(A)P(B^c)=P(A)(1-P(B))=P(A)-P(A)P(B)=P(A)P(A+B)$

However, this is not valid, as A, B are indeed
